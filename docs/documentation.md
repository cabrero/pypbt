## framework: diatixis.fr

When we take a look a [di√°taxis.fr](https://diataxis.fr), its ideas seem
obvious. That's why we must read it.

Another useful resource is this article about [documentation
systems](https://documentation.divio.com/)

## style

- We mainly use 1st person plural.
  
  2nd person sounds imperative, the passive voice is impersonal and
  1st person plural should show some emphathy on the reader.

  The reader is learning a new subject: how to use this library. By
  showing empathy we try to ease the learning process.
  
- Exception: api refence.

  We should provide objetive and unambiguous data in a clean editoral staff style.
