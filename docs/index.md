These pages documents the diverse aspects of the development of PyPBT including:

  - Writing user documentation
  
  - The design of the library
  
  - The development and deployment processes

  - Bibliography references used during the research phase


# Why yet another library ?

Our motivation was to answer:

  - Is it possible another approach to the design and implementation ?
  
  - Providing it is, this approach eases writing and reading the properties ?


## What's next if the answers are yes ?

The library will be missing several features that were not neccessary
to answer the questions.  But these features are almost essential in
order to use the library in production. For example:

  - Shrinking.
  
  - Integration with test runners.
  
  - Different sampling strategies.
  
  - ...

At this point we would be able to continue our work in two ways:

  - Continue the development of the library adding the missing
    features.
	
  - Answering a new question: is this approach valid to improve
    other libraries, even in other programming languages ?
