# Welcome to pypbt's documentation!

This library will help you in writing *property based tests* (_PBTs_)
in python. If you are not, yet, familiar with PBT, check this
[introduction](pbt-intro).

Here you are a list of features to consider when choosing it:

  - The resulting properties are as idiomatic as posible.
  
  - The resulting property expressions resembles as much as possible
    the usual matthematical language.
  
  - The complex concepts like inifinte sets are implemented as real
    python objects. Not combinations of functions, loops, etc.
	
  
!!! warning
	This is a work in progress.
	
	Our first goals are to validate the design of the library and
	to check whether the properties written using this library
	are easier to write and read.
	
	Some features like _shrinking_ come after those in the to-do list.
	
	
In order to learn how to use the library, you can start reading the
[tutorial](tutorials). If you want to known more about the philosophy
behind this implemetation of _PBT_, please check the
[explanation section](explanation).

Once you become familiar with the library, you can check futher
examples at the [how-to section](howtos), or even consult its
[_api_](api).
